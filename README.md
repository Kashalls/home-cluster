## Overview

I ended up pushing this README before I wrote this, so this is a placeholder. Thanks.

### Required Addons

I wrote a couple addons for this to work. These addons requires physical devices for them to work.
- [AirGradient Prometheus Server](https://github.com/Kashalls/airgradient-prometheus-sensor)
